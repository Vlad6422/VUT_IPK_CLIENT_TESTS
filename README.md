# Warning

I updated IPK24->IPK25 and passed all tests. But made it in 30 min, so it can have troubles.

## üìö Info

Testing server for testing the TCP/UDP messaging client for the IPK project 2025 written in Python. Feel free to use it and modify it however you want.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è I am not an expert in communications nor Python so go on with caution. Any problems that you might find you can hit me up (email/discord) or create a PR.

## üîÑ Usage

The specific usage can be listed with the `-h` flag, but here's probably the most important stuff:

- `<path_to_executable>` - provide the path to the client executable
- `-p <udp|tcp>` - choose the tested protocol (default is both)
- `-d` - will show both `stdout` and `stdin` of the running client
- `-t <testcase_name>` - run a specific test case only

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

You might need to install `termcolor` if you don't have it yet using `pip3 install termcolor`.
